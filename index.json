Frequently, multiple databases with different origins and data characteristics are combined to address new research questions. Taxonomic name harmonization, i.e., the process of standardizing taxon names according to common sources such as taxonomic databases (TD), is necessary to properly combine multiple databases using species names. In order to be able to develop proper data matching workflows, TDs and tools using them need to be clearly and comprehensively described. But this is rarely the case. Common problems users have to deal with are: poorly described taxonomic concepts behind biological databases, lack of information when TDs are actively updated, and details regarding where the primary source of taxonomic information comes from (e.g., secondary TDs taking information from primary TDs). In addition, software to access these TDs is not always advertised, partly redundant, or developed with incompatible standards, creating additional challenges for users. As a result, taxonomic name harmonization has become a major difficulty in ecological studies. Researchers face a jungle of primary and secondary TDs with a diversity of tools to access them and no clear workflow on how to practically proceed. As a consequence, it is hard for users to know which TD, tool and workflow will fit the task at hand and lead to the most robust results when combining different biological datasets.\n Here, we present an overview of major TDs as well as an extensive review of R packages to access TDs, and to harmonize taxa names. We developed an R Shiny web application summarizing meta-data and linkages among TDs and R packages (Figs 1, 2), which users can explore to learn about general features of TDs and tools and how they are linked among one another. This is particularly helpful to assist users when deciding on the TDs and tools that best fit the tasks and data at hand and to develop more informed workflows for taxonomic name harmonization. Finally, from our review and using the Shiny app, we were able to provide general best practice principles to harmonize taxonomic names and avoid common pitfalls.","tags":[],"title":"Matching Species Names Across Biodiversity Databases: Sources, tools, pitfalls and best practices for taxonomic harmonization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Macroecology is the ecology of large spatial and/or temporal scale.

Here, we propose a unified framework and a synthesis across 30 trait datasets representing a broad variety of taxa, ecosystems and spatial scales to show that a common trade-off between trait space quality and operationality appears between three and six dimensions. The robustness to trait omission is generally low but highly variable among datasets. We also highlight invariant scaling relationships, whatever organismal complexity, between the number of clusters, the number of species in the dominant cluster and the number of unique species with total species richness. When species richness increases, the number of unique species saturates, whereas species tend to disproportionately pack in the richest cluster.

We find that ecologically rare species are disproportionately represented in IUCN threatened categories, insufficiently covered by protected areas, and for some of them sensitive to current and future threats. While they are more abundant overall in countries with a low human development index, some countries with high human development index are also hotspots of ecological rarity, suggesting transboundary responsibility for their conservation.

Alternative methods propose to combine outputs from SDMs differently, by either summing predicted presence probabilities at each location, or summing binary presence predictions after thresholding the probabilities. Species can occupy various proportions of their suitable habitats (i.e, have various levels of habitat saturation), which can cause discrepancy when predicting their presences through SDMs. Furthermore, these discrepancies can be increased when combining the predictions of individual SDMs to predict SR. In this article, we performed simulations of species distributions with varying habitat saturation (i.e., the amount of suitable habitat occupied by a species), and we compared observed richness with that predicted by the alternative approaches. We found that probability-based richness is not biased by the level of habitat saturation, while threshold-based richness over-predicts richness at low habitat saturation and under-predicts it as high habitat saturation. Probability-based richness should thus be used in priority when predicting species richness locally. Nonetheless, threshold-based richness represents species richness constrained by environmental filtering only and thus is a useful indicator of potential species richness when species fully saturate their habitats. Thus the systematic comparison of probability-based and threshold-based richness predictions can reveal the importance of habitat saturation and can thus help identify community assembly mechanisms at play.\n","tags":["habitat saturation","Species Richness","Stacked species distribution models (SSDMs)","Predicted presence probabilities","Threshold-based prediction"],"title":"Is prediction of species richness from stacked species distribution models biased by habitat saturation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Yves Barnagaud","Nathan Mazet","François Munoz","**Matthias Grenié**","Pierre Denelle","Mar Sobral","W.

Although orthogonal at the species level, these dimensions were correlated among species assemblages, with regional variation consistent with past climatic and tectonic events. Human footprint packed bird assemblages in the diet space, while warm climate, high productivity and high topography were associated with high variability in the prevalence of dietary strategies among assemblages.\n\n**Main conclusions**\n\nThe tremendous variability in bird dietary strategies can be explained by a few basic ecological continuums sustained by morphological and ecophysiological differences among species.

Pollination niches are important components of ecological niches and have played a major role in the diversification of Angiosperms. In this study, we focused on Euro‐Mediterranean orchids, which use diverse pollination strategies and interact with various functional groups of insects. In these orchids, we investigated the determinants of pollination niche breadth and overlap by analysing the orchid–pollinator network and the factors that may have shaped it.\n2. We constructed a database reporting 1,278 interactions between 243 orchid and 773 pollinator species based on a thorough literature review. We then focused on 153 orchid species for which phylogenetic data were available. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to study the relationship between specialisation (as estimated by the degree and degree in the projected network), pollination strategy and breadths of orchids’ spatial and temporal distributions, while correcting for the effect of phylogenetic relationships among orchid species and sampling effort. We then used a singular value decomposition of the orchid–pollinator matrix combined to a redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the determinants of similarity in pollination niches between orchids.\n3. Specialisation was higher in deceptive than in nectar‐producing orchids and decreased with the breadth of orchids’ spatial distribution. When interactions were considered at the insect family level, similarity in pollination niches between orchids was solely explained by their pollination strategy and phylogeny. By contrast, when they were considered at the insect species level, this similarity was primarily explained by their geographical range and flowering time, although other factors had significant effects as well, with orchids using the same pollination strategy, being closely related and growing in the same habitats sharing more insect species than expected.\n4. Synthesis. Specialisation in orchid–pollinator interactions depends on orchids’ pollination strategy and geographical range. The pool of insect families with which orchids interact depends on their pollination strategy and phylogeny, with consistent associations between some functional or phylogenetic groups of orchids and some families of pollinators. By contrast, the pool of insect species with which orchids interact depends on their spatio‐temporal distribution, suggesting that at a finer scale, orchid–pollinator interactions are more opportunistic than previously thought.\n","tags":[],"title":"Effect of pollination strategy, phylogeny and distribution on pollination niches of Euro‐Mediterranean orchids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyrille Violle","Wilfried Thuiller","Nicolas Mouquet","François Munoz","Nathan J.B.

Moreover,  identifying the distribution and drivers of functional rarity across space and time is of tremendous importance for conservation ecology.  However, functional rarity remains an overlooked facet of functional diversity.\nWe used a worldwide coral reef fish database comprising 2073 species occurrences in 259 locations with complete information for 6 traits related to major ecological functions as well as a phylogenetic tree of all those species.  Functional Rarity is defined as the originality of a species given its neighbor in a community.  For each species we computed functional rarity, evolutionary distinctiveness and geographic range indices.\nWe found that evolutionary distinctiveness of a species does not correlate with functional rarity. Species restrictedness in space and functional distinctiveness let us classify species in different categories:  functionally rare or common \u0026 geographically restricted or widespread at a global scale.
