Achieving this goal requires simplifying this complexity in synthetic axes defining a trait space and to cluster species based on their traits while identifying those with unique combinations of traits. However, so far, we know little about the dimensionality, the robustness to trait omission and the structure of these trait spaces. Here, we propose a unified framework and a synthesis across 30 trait datasets representing a broad variety of taxa, ecosystems and spatial scales to show that a common trade-off between trait space quality and operationality appears between three and six dimensions. The robustness to trait omission is generally low but highly variable among datasets. We also highlight invariant scaling relationships, whatever organismal complexity, between the number of clusters, the number of species in the dominant cluster and the number of unique species with total species richness. When species richness increases, the number of unique species saturates, whereas species tend to disproportionately pack in the richest cluster. Based on these results, we propose some rules of thumb to build species trait spaces and estimate subsequent functional diversity indices.\r\n","tags":["complexity","functional ecology","hypervolume","species clustering","species uniqueness"],"title":"The dimensionality and structure of species trait spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Loiseau","Nicolas Mouquet","Nicolas Casajus","**Matthias Grenié**","Maya Guéguen","Brian Maitner","David Mouillot","Annette Ostling","Julien Renaud","Caroline M.

We use global species distributions and functional traits for birds and mammals to identify the ecologically rare species, understand their characteristics, and identify hotspots. We find that ecologically rare species are disproportionately represented in IUCN threatened categories, insufficiently covered by protected areas, and for some of them sensitive to current and future threats. While they are more abundant overall in countries with a low human development index, some countries with high human development index are also hotspots of ecological rarity, suggesting transboundary responsibility for their conservation.

Alternative methods propose to combine outputs from SDMs differently, by either summing predicted presence probabilities at each location, or summing binary presence predictions after thresholding the probabilities. Species can occupy various proportions of their suitable habitats (i.e, have various levels of habitat saturation), which can cause discrepancy when predicting their presences through SDMs. Furthermore, these discrepancies can be increased when combining the predictions of individual SDMs to predict SR. In this article, we performed simulations of species distributions with varying habitat saturation (i.e., the amount of suitable habitat occupied by a species), and we compared observed richness with that predicted by the alternative approaches. We found that probability-based richness is not biased by the level of habitat saturation, while threshold-based richness over-predicts richness at low habitat saturation and under-predicts it as high habitat saturation. Probability-based richness should thus be used in priority when predicting species richness locally. Nonetheless, threshold-based richness represents species richness constrained by environmental filtering only and thus is a useful indicator of potential species richness when species fully saturate their habitats. Thus the systematic comparison of probability-based and threshold-based richness predictions can reveal the importance of habitat saturation and can thus help identify community assembly mechanisms at play.\r\n","tags":["habitat saturation","Species Richness","Stacked species distribution models (SSDMs)","Predicted presence probabilities","Threshold-based prediction"],"title":"Is prediction of species richness from stacked species distribution models biased by habitat saturation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Yves Barnagaud","Nathan Mazet","François Munoz","**Matthias Grenié**","Pierre Denelle","Mar Sobral","W.

We constructed a multivariate diet space by ordinating these data in a principal coordinates analysis, and assessed its dimensionality as a balance between representation of original diet scores and parsimony. We averaged species’ positions along each dimension of the diet space for 12705 spatial species assemblages and used quantile regressions to infer the relative contributions of species richness, climate, primary productivity, topography and human footprint to these patterns. \r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nBirds’ diet space was structured by four dimensions ordinating species along continuums ranging from = insectivory to plant–based strategies, granivory to frugivory, common to rare diets and nectarivory to carnivory and piscivory. Although orthogonal at the species level, these dimensions were correlated among species assemblages, with regional variation consistent with past climatic and tectonic events. Human footprint packed bird assemblages in the diet space, while warm climate, high productivity and high topography were associated with high variability in the prevalence of dietary strategies among assemblages.\r\n\r\n**Main conclusions**\r\n\r\nThe tremendous variability in bird dietary strategies can be explained by a few basic ecological continuums sustained by morphological and ecophysiological differences among species. Strong biogeographic legacies on top of bioclimatic drivers distribute this diet space in species assemblages through environmental filtering and niche packing. However, these patterns are altered at macroecological scales by human–mediated functional homogenization which may in turn affect the global distribution of bird functions and services.","tags":[],"title":"Functional biogeography of dietary strategies in birds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Matthias Grenié**","David Mouillot","Sébastien Villéger","Pierre Denelle","Caroline M.

Pollination niches are important components of ecological niches and have played a major role in the diversification of Angiosperms. In this study, we focused on Euro‐Mediterranean orchids, which use diverse pollination strategies and interact with various functional groups of insects. In these orchids, we investigated the determinants of pollination niche breadth and overlap by analysing the orchid–pollinator network and the factors that may have shaped it.\r\n2. We constructed a database reporting 1,278 interactions between 243 orchid and 773 pollinator species based on a thorough literature review. We then focused on 153 orchid species for which phylogenetic data were available. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to study the relationship between specialisation (as estimated by the degree and degree in the projected network), pollination strategy and breadths of orchids’ spatial and temporal distributions, while correcting for the effect of phylogenetic relationships among orchid species and sampling effort. We then used a singular value decomposition of the orchid–pollinator matrix combined to a redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the determinants of similarity in pollination niches between orchids.\r\n3. Specialisation was higher in deceptive than in nectar‐producing orchids and decreased with the breadth of orchids’ spatial distribution. When interactions were considered at the insect family level, similarity in pollination niches between orchids was solely explained by their pollination strategy and phylogeny. By contrast, when they were considered at the insect species level, this similarity was primarily explained by their geographical range and flowering time, although other factors had significant effects as well, with orchids using the same pollination strategy, being closely related and growing in the same habitats sharing more insect species than expected.\r\n4. Synthesis. Specialisation in orchid–pollinator interactions depends on orchids’ pollination strategy and geographical range. The pool of insect families with which orchids interact depends on their pollination strategy and phylogeny, with consistent associations between some functional or phylogenetic groups of orchids and some families of pollinators. By contrast, the pool of insect species with which orchids interact depends on their spatio‐temporal distribution, suggesting that at a finer scale, orchid–pollinator interactions are more opportunistic than previously thought.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"Effect of pollination strategy, phylogeny and distribution on pollination niches of Euro‐Mediterranean orchids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyrille Violle","Wilfried Thuiller","Nicolas Mouquet","François Munoz","Nathan J.B.

Environmental filtering weights the probability of immigration success depending on trait values, while the descendants of established immigrants undergo neutral stochastic drift.

The package provides a process-based alternative to the use of randomization-based null models.\r\n3. The package proposes a coalescent-based simulation algorithm that presents significant advantages over alternative algorithms.
