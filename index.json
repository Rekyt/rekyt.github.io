We aimed to identify the major strategies that shape birds’ diet space, and to investigate their spatial distributions in association with biogeographic, bioclimatic and anthropogenic drivers. Location – Global. Time period – Current. Major taxa studied – Birds. Methods – We analysed score–based assessments of eight diet categories for 8937 out of 10964 extant species. We constructed a multivariate diet space by ordinating these data in a principal coordinates analysis, and assessed its dimensionality as a balance between representation of original diet scores and parsimony. We averaged species’ positions along each dimension of the diet space for 12705 spatial species assemblages and used quantile regressions to infer the relative contributions of species richness, climate, primary productivity, topography and human footprint to these patterns. Results – Birds’ diet space was structured by four dimensions ordinating species along continuums ranging from = insectivory to plant–based strategies, granivory to frugivory, common to rare diets and nectarivory to carnivory and piscivory. Although orthogonal at the species level, these dimensions were correlated among species assemblages, with regional variation consistent with past climatic and tectonic events. Human footprint packed bird assemblages in the diet space, while warm climate, high productivity and high topography were associated with high variability in the prevalence of dietary strategies among assemblages. Main conclusions – The tremendous variability in bird dietary strategies can be explained by a few basic ecological continuums sustained by morphological and ecophysiological differences among species. Strong biogeographic legacies on top of bioclimatic drivers distribute this diet space in species assemblages through environmental filtering and niche packing. However, these patterns are altered at macroecological scales by human–mediated functional homogenization which may in turn affect the global distribution of bird functions and services.","tags":null,"title":"Functional biogeography of dietary strategies in birds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Grenié","David Mouillot","Sébastien Villéger","Pierre Denelle","Caroline M.

Understanding the role of species with rare traits, i.e. functionally rare species, in community assembly, ecosystem dynamics and functioning has recently gained momentum. However, functional rarity is still ignored in conservation strategies. Here, we quantified global functional and evolutionary rarity for 2073 species of coral reef fishes and compared the rarity values to IUCN Red List status. Most species were functionally common but geographically rare. However, we found very weak correlation between functional rarity and evolutionary rarity. Functional rarity was highest for species classified as not evaluated or threatened by the IUCN Red List. The location of functional rarity hotspots (Tropical Eastern Pacific) did not match hotspots of species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness (Indo-Australian Archipelago), nor the currently protected areas. We argue that functional rarity should be acknowledged for both species and site prioritization in conservation strategies.","tags":["functional distinctiveness","evolutionary distinctiveness","coral triangle","funrar","biodiversity facet"],"title":"Functional rarity of coral reef fishes at the global scale: Hotspots and challenges for conservation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1531440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531440000,"objectID":"8db8389b86056fea680b8295944c9859","permalink":"https://rekyt.github.io/talk/species-richness-unicorns-bes-macro-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/species-richness-unicorns-bes-macro-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Species Richness with Unicorns \u0026 SDMs or why thresholds should be abandoned?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Functional rarity is a concept developed by Violle et al.

Pollination niches are important components of ecological niches and have played a major role in the diversification of Angiosperms. In this study, we focused on Euro‐Mediterranean orchids, which use diverse pollination strategies and interact with various functional groups of insects. In these orchids, we investigated the determinants of pollination niche breadth and overlap by analysing the orchid–pollinator network and the factors that may have shaped it. 2. We constructed a database reporting 1,278 interactions between 243 orchid and 773 pollinator species based on a thorough literature review. We then focused on 153 orchid species for which phylogenetic data were available. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to study the relationship between specialisation (as estimated by the degree and degree in the projected network), pollination strategy and breadths of orchids’ spatial and temporal distributions, while correcting for the effect of phylogenetic relationships among orchid species and sampling effort. We then used a singular value decomposition of the orchid–pollinator matrix combined to a redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the determinants of similarity in pollination niches between orchids. 3. Specialisation was higher in deceptive than in nectar‐producing orchids and decreased with the breadth of orchids’ spatial distribution. When interactions were considered at the insect family level, similarity in pollination niches between orchids was solely explained by their pollination strategy and phylogeny. By contrast, when they were considered at the insect species level, this similarity was primarily explained by their geographical range and flowering time, although other factors had significant effects as well, with orchids using the same pollination strategy, being closely related and growing in the same habitats sharing more insect species than expected. 4. Synthesis. Specialisation in orchid–pollinator interactions depends on orchids’ pollination strategy and geographical range. The pool of insect families with which orchids interact depends on their pollination strategy and phylogeny, with consistent associations between some functional or phylogenetic groups of orchids and some families of pollinators. By contrast, the pool of insect species with which orchids interact depends on their spatio‐temporal distribution, suggesting that at a finer scale, orchid–pollinator interactions are more opportunistic than previously thought.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of pollination strategy, phylogeny and distribution on pollination niches of Euro‐Mediterranean orchids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyrille Violle","Wilfried Thuiller","Nicolas Mouquet","François Munoz","Nathan J.B.

While a flourishing number of indices have been proposed for assessing functional diversity, surprisingly few options are available to characterize functional rarity.

We introduce the R package ecolottery dedicated to quick and efficient simulation of communities undergoing local neutral dynamics with environmentally filtered immigration from a reference species pool (spatially implicit model). The package includes an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) tool to estimate the parameters of these processes. We present the rationale of the approach and show examples of simulations and ABC analysis. 2. The species in the reference pool differ in their abundances and trait values. Environmental filtering weights the probability of immigration success depending on trait values, while the descendants of established immigrants undergo neutral stochastic drift. The reference pool can be defined in a flexible way as representing, e.g. the composition of a broad biogeographical region, or available dispersers around local communities. The package provides a process-based alternative to the use of randomization-based null models. 3. The package proposes a coalescent-based simulation algorithm that presents significant advantages over alternative algorithms. It does not require simulating community dynamics from an initial state forward in time but does still allow measurement of the influence of environmental filtering. Because of its high calculation speed, this approach allows simulating many communities within a reasonable amount of time. 4. Diverse patterns of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic compositions can be generated. The package can be used to explore the outcome of ecological and evolutionary processes playing at local and regional scales, and to estimate the parameters of these processes based on observed patterns.","tags":[],"title":"ecolottery: Simulating and assessing community assembly with environmental filtering and neutral dynamics in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1486425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486425600,"objectID":"1d1f17a05462139d926d9c6e1c49dd07","permalink":"https://rekyt.github.io/talk/functional-rarity-ynhm-2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/functional-rarity-ynhm-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Functionally  rare  species  can  support  unique  functions  for  ecosystems.   Moreover,  identifying the distribution and drivers of functional rarity across space and time is of tremendous importance for conservation ecology.  However, functional rarity remains an overlooked facet of functional diversity.\nWe used a worldwide coral reef fish database comprising 2073 species occurrences in 259 locations with complete information for 6 traits related to major ecological functions as well as a phylogenetic tree of all those species.  Functional Rarity is defined as the originality of a species given its neighbor in a community.  For each species we computed functional rarity, evolutionary distinctiveness and geographic range indices.\nWe found that evolutionary distinctiveness of a species does not correlate with functional rarity. Species restrictedness in space and functional distinctiveness let us classify species in different categories:  functionally rare or common \u0026 geographically restricted or widespread at a global scale. Our  results  show  that  the  originality  of  a  species  by  its  traits  cannot  be  estimated  from  its position  in  a  phylogenetic  tree.
